# Steam-Curator-Game-Manager
Enhance Steam Curator admin with this Tampermonkey userscript: Add checkboxes to filter/hide reviewed or unwanted accepted games (bypassing the 2000-review limit), with visibility toggles, review status filters, bulk select, import/export JSON states, and multi-language support (EN, zh-TW, zh-CN).
